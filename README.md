# PROJECT ARRHYTHMIA

## Disclaimer
This repository does not have any official medical affiliation.

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting and classifying arrhythmia using various machine learning algorithms.
The dataset used for this project is from the:
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia)
This data consists of 452 examples across 16 different classes. Among these, 245 examples are labeled as "Normal," while the remaining represent 12 different types of arrhythmias, including "Coronary artery disease" and "Right bundle branch block"

**Objectives**
The goal of this project is to predict whether a person suffers from arrhythmia, and if they do suffer from arrhythmia, classify the type of arrhythmia into one of the 12 available groups.

## Algorithms used in the project
 1. **K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) Classifier**
 2. **Logistic Regression**
 3. **Decision Tree Classifier**
 4. **Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
 5. **Kernelized Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
 6. **Random Forest Classifier**
 7. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** (For dimensionality reduction)
